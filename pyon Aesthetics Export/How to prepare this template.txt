-How to perpare your team's aesthetic export-

(Warning: You don't need to replace the XXX in the files and folders.
 Just leave it as it is, the compiler will take care of replacing it with the
 proper team ID when importing the export.)

--Required--

Note txt:
- Replace the --- in the "--- Note.txt" filename and in the export's folder name
  with your team's name, without slashes.
- Open the Note txt and fill it with your team's details by following
  the guide included.


Kit Configs:
- If you only have two kits, you can use the included kit configs.
  If you have more you'll need to duplicate the p1 config, name it p3, p4 and so
  on, and open it with a kit config editor to change the texture name inside it
  from p1 to p3, p4, etc.


Kit Textures:
- Replace the included main textures with your team's kits.
  You can either customize the number and name textures or use the included
  ones.
  If you want to have more kits, duplicate a set of textures and replace p1 with
  p3. Make sure to do the same with the kit configs.


Logo:
- Replace the included files with the team's logo pictures, and make sure they
  follow the same names as the included logo files.
  
  Required files:
  emblem_0XXX_r.png (128x128 pixels) (mainly used in tactical screens)
  emblem_0XXX_r_l.png (256x256 pixels) (mainly used in menus)
  emblem_0XXX_r_ll.png (512x512 pixels) (mainly used in the match intro)
  
  The three images do not have to be the exact same logo. You can use a
  simplified version for the smaller one, or whatever you can think of.


Portraits:
- Copy the team's player portraits and make sure they follow the naming
  "player_XXXxx.dds", where xx is the player number in the team
  (between 01 and 23).
  Example: player_XXX06.dds
  
  Each player's portrait consists in a DDS (DXT5, 128x128) texture.
  They are shown in the tactical screens.
  
  If a player has a custom face folder you should include their portrait there
  instead.


--Optional--

Faces:
- Copy your team's face folders to this folder, and rename them to
  "XXXxx - ______", where xx is the player number in the team (between 01 to 23)
  and ______ is the player's name.
  Example: XXX11 - Smug Redman

  Don't use the symbol ! in the player's name.
  You should put that player's portrait here, with the name "portrait.dds".


Boots:
- Copy the team's boots folders (if any) to this folder, and make sure they
  follow the naming "k#### - ______", where #### is the boots ID and ______ is
  the player name it is used for, or, if the model is used on multiple players,
  simply a description of what it is.
  Example: k0600 - Armor kit
  
  Make sure to only use the IDs reserved to your team to avoid overwritings.

Gloves:
- Copy the team's GK gloves folders (if any) to this folder, and make sure they
  follow the naming "g####", where #### is the boot ID and ______ is the player
  name it is used for, or, if the model is used on multiple players, simply a
  description of what it is.
  Example: g0601 - Armor gloves
  
  Make sure to only use the IDs reserved to your team to avoid overwritings.
  They're the same as the boots IDs, so using the same boots and glove ID on a
  player is recommended.


Collar:
- Copy the team's custom collar models used as collars for your team.
  The filename format is simply "collar_###.fmdl", where ### is the collar ID.
  Please contact the aesthetic helper beforehand to reserve the ID slots you
  want to use and to make sure they aren't currently in use.


Common:
- Copy any files you want to share across multiple players, this allows you to
  avoid adding them to each of their face folders, saving space in the export.
  See the AET wikipage for more details.


--Wrapping up--

- Balls and stadiums must not be added to the export, send them
  directly to someone from the Aesthetics Council.

- Once you've finished filling the export, remove any of the folders
  you haven't used. Then delete this guide txt or move it somewhere else.

- Check the bottom of the AET wikipage for the link to download the compiler,
  which you can use to easily get your stuff into the game and check if
  everything works properly.

- Once you've check everything works fine, you can finally zip your export,
  upload it and put the link on the cup's export page.

- If you have any questions, feel free to contact Shakes or any other
  member of the Aesthetics Council.
